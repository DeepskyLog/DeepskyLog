# Recover password
1. The user enters his username and hits "forgot password" or the email
address instead of the username, because usernames are sometimes forgotten
too.
  + When clicking Change password:
    + Show: To change your password, enter a new password twice:...   Submit

4. When the user clicks the link in the email, he is moved to your page. The page retrieves the ID from the URL, hashes it again, and checks against
      the table. If such a record is there and is no more than, say, 24 hours old, the user is presented with the prompt to enter a new password.

5. The user enters a new password, hits OK and everyone lives happily ever after... until next time!
