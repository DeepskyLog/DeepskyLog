// TODO: Recover password
// 1) The user enters his username and hits "forgot password" or the email address instead of the username,
//     because usernames are sometimes forgotten too.
//    TODO: Send nice looking html email, with html showing the DeepskyLog logo, ...
//    Content: You have (or someone impersonating you has) requested to change your
      Bugzilla password. To complete the change, visit the following link:

      http://www.miricle.org/bugzilla/token.cgi?t=qBOR3mStV5&a=cfmpw

      If you are not the person who made this request, or you wish to cancel
      this request, visit the following link:

      http://www.miricle.org/bugzilla/token.cgi?t=qBOR3mStV5&a=cxlpw

      If you do nothing, the request will lapse after 24 hours
        (on November 2, 2015 at 15:01 CET) or when you
        log in successfully.

      A) When clicking on Cancel request.
        1) Show:  Your request has been canceled.
        2) Send mail:
           A request was canceled from 10.33.178.31.
           If you did not request this, it could be either an honest mistake or someone attempting to break into your Bugzilla account.
      B) When clicking Change password:
        1) Show: To change your password, enter a new password twice:...   Submit
//    TODO: Adapt the other mails that are sent to use html.
// 2) The system has a table password_change_requests with the columns ID, Time and UserID. When the new user presses the button, a record is created
      in the table. The Time column contains the time when the user pressed the "Forgot Password" button. The ID is a string. A long random string is
      created (say, a GUID) and then hashed like a password (which is a separate topic in and of itself). This hash is then used as the 'ID' in the
      table: DONE
// 3) The system sends an email to the user which contains a link in it. The link also contains the original ID string (before the hashing). The link
      will be something like this: http://www.mysite.com/forgotpassword.jsp?ID=01234567890ABCDEF. The forgotpassword.jsp page should be able to retrieve
      the ID parameter.
// 4) When the user clicks the link in the email, he is moved to your page. The page retrieves the ID from the URL, hashes it again, and checks against
      the table. If such a record is there and is no more than, say, 24 hours old, the user is presented with the prompt to enter a new password.
// 5) The user enters a new password, hits OK and everyone lives happily ever after... until next time!
