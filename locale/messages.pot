"developed by the deepsky-section of the VVS. The database already contains "
"tens of thousands observations and thousands of sketches and drawings made "
"by amateur astronomers around the world. After you have registered for "
"DeepskyLog, you get access to a variety of useful tools:<br /><br />\n"
"<ul><li>Information on the observations you made, the objects observed and "
"sketches made,</li>\n"
"    <li>observing lists with different deepsky objects,</li>\n"
"    <li>you can share your observations with other observers,</li>\n"
"    <li>translate function to read observations in other languages,</li>\n"
"    <li>free atlases,</li>\n"
"    <li>create your own file with maps and DSS images of the objects,</li>\n"
"    <li>interactive star atlas down to magnitude 16,</li>\n"
"    <li>suggestions for objects visible in your instruments,</li>\n"
"    <li>information about the objects that are visible from your observation "
"sites.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"To start recording your observations, you need an account, which you can get "
"after registration. Please contact the <a href=\"mailto:"
"developers@deepskylog.be\">DeepskyLog developers</a> if you encounter "
"problems or have questions."
