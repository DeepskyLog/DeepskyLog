# DeepskyLog

DeepskyLog is a web application to prepare, log and compare Deep-Sky and comet observations.

Observers can use the website at [https://www.deepskylog.org](https://www.deepskylog.org/)

## Help DeepskyLog

DeepskyLog is free and will always be free. If you want to donate money to DeepskyLog, we will use it to upgrade our servers to improve the speed and the disk space.

When you want to help developing, but you don't know how to do html/css/javascript developing, a nice place to learn to code is [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/).

We ask everyone to use the official [DeepskyLog](https://www.deepskylog.org/) website. So please, don't set up your own DeepskyLog site. One of the major advantages of DeepskyLog is that we have one large database with more than 125,000 observations and more than 15,000 drawings. We don't want to have databases all over the internet.

At this moment, DeepskyLog can be accessed using the following sites:

| URL | Standard Language |
| --- | ----------------- |
| [https://www.deepskylog.org](https://www.deepskylog.org/) | English |
| [https://www.deepskylog.be](https://www.deepskylog.be/) | Dutch |
| [https://www.deepskylog.nl](https://www.deepskylog.nl/) | Dutch |
| [https://www.deepskylog.fr](https://www.deepskylog.fr/) | French |
| [https://www.deepskylog.de](https://www.deepskylog.de/) | German |
| [https://www.deepskylog.se](https://www.deepskylog.se/) | English |

If you want to add your own localised version of the DeepskyLog database, please contact us.

## Localisation / translation

At this moment, [DeepskyLog](https://www.deepskylog.org/) is translated in the following languages:

| Language | % complete |

TODO: Fix the translation workflow
If you spot a mistake in one of the translations, please let us know or change the problem yourself by adapting the messages.po file in [GitHub](https://github.com/DeepskyLog/DeepskyLog/tree/master/locale/). You can easily edit the po files using an editor, for example [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).

If you are interested in adding a new language to [DeepskyLog](https://www.deepskylog.org), you can use the [messages.pot file](https://github.com/DeepskyLog/DeepskyLog/tree/master/locale/messages.pot) to create a new translation. You can also contact us, then we can help to get you started.
