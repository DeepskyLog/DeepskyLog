# DeepskyLog

> Log and compare your visual astronomical observations

* Visit [DeepskyLog](https://www.deepskylog.org) and start using a web application to prepare, log, and compare visual astronomical observations.
* You can find more than 150,000 observations and 17,000 sketches in DeepskyLog. There are visual observations of
  * Deep-sky objects
  * Comets
  * Planets
  * Moon
  * Sun
* Photographic observations are unfortunately not allowed in DeepskyLog. A very good website to log your photographic observations is [Astrobin](https://www.astrobin.com/welcome/).
* Be part of the community and start sharing your observations and sketches today!
* DeepskyLog is free to use and will always be free to use. If you want to sponsor DeepskyLog, we will use it to upgrade our servers to improve the speed and the disk space. Sponsoring can be done by clicking the **Sponsor** button on top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/DeepskyLog/DeepskyLog).
* If you like DeepskyLog, give it a star. It means a lot to the people maintaining it.

## Want to contribute?

* Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* DeepskyLog is always looking for amateur astronomers to help improving DeepskyLog. You don't need to be a programmer to help us! We are also looking for Deep-sky database maintainers, translators, testers, bug triaging, documentation writers, ... As it is unfortunately not always clear to observe, amateur astronomers can still do astronomy by helping out the DeepskyLog team! Be part of the DeepskyLog community today!
* If you want to help us improve, take a minute to read the [Contribution Guidelines](Contributing.md) first.
* If you find a problem with the behavior, database or translation of DeepskyLog, please [open an issue](https://github.com/DeepskyLog/DeepskyLog/issues/new/choose).
