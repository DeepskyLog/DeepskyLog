# DeepskyLog

DeepskyLog is a web application to prepare, log and compare visual astronomical observations (Deep-Sky, comets, planets, moon, ...).

Observers can use the website at [https://www.deepskylog.org](https://www.deepskylog.org/)

## Help DeepskyLog

DeepskyLog is free and will always be free. If you want to donate money to DeepskyLog, we will use it to upgrade our servers to improve the speed and the disk space.

DeepskyLog is written in php and uses the laravel framework.

We ask everyone to use the official [DeepskyLog](https://www.deepskylog.org/) website. So please, don't set up your own DeepskyLog site. One of the major advantages of DeepskyLog is that we have one large database with more than 130,000 observations and more than 15,000 drawings. We don't want to have databases all over the internet.

At this moment, DeepskyLog can be accessed using the following sites:

| URL | Standard Language |
| --- | ----------------- |
| [https://www.deepskylog.org](https://www.deepskylog.org/) | English |
| [https://www.deepskylog.be](https://www.deepskylog.be/) | Dutch |
| [https://www.deepskylog.nl](https://www.deepskylog.nl/) | Dutch |
| [https://www.deepskylog.fr](https://www.deepskylog.fr/) | French |
| [https://www.deepskylog.de](https://www.deepskylog.de/) | German |
| [https://www.deepskylog.se](https://www.deepskylog.se/) | English |

If you want to add your own localised version of the DeepskyLog database, please contact us.
