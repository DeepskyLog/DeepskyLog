# What's new in DeepskyLog.laravel

## Functionality

+ Added planets, moon (craters, maria, ...), and sun to the list of objects. Comets don't have a separate module anymore, but are now part of the main DeepskyLog module.
+ Pictures for locations, instruments, eyepieces, filters and lenses
+ Totally rewritten messages, now sorted in threads, easy to add new users to the thread.
+ Add country of origen to the settings. This makes it possible to search for all observations done by inhabitants of a country (even if they did a lot of observations in another country)
+ Registering doesn't need a manual intervention anymore. The newly registered user receives a mail to activate the registration.

## Technology

+ Uses laravel 5.8
