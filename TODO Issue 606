### Issue 606: Missing objects in lists after changing from private to public and adding extra objects

##### TEST
+ Make a new private list: Testlijst 2
+ Add objects to this list: M 12, M14
+ Check in database: public = 0;
+ Change list to public
+ Check in database: public = 1
+ Check when logged out if the list is available with all objects: ok
+ Add some extra objects: M 16
+ Check in database: New object has public = 0??
+ Check when logged out if all objects are in the list.

##### TODO
+ Why are the newly added objects after the list was made public not public anymore?

##### DONE
+ When changing the list to public (or private), only change the list of the observer, not all lists with that name.
+ When there is a public list with the same name as your private list, only show the objects from the correct list.
+ Don't let the user make a list public when there is already a public list with the same name.
