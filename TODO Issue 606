### Issue 606: Missing objects in lists after changing from private to public and adding extra objects

##### TODO
+ Make a new private list: Testlijst 2
+ Add objects to this list: M 12, M14
+ Check in database: public = 0;
+ Change list to public
+ Check in database: public = 1, but for all lists with that name, not only for the observer which made the list public!
+ Check when logged out if the list is available with all objects: ok
+ Add some extra objects: M 16
+ Check in database: New object has public = 0??
+ Check when logged out if all objects are in the list.

TODO:
+ When changing the list to public (or private), only change the list of the observer, not all lists with that name.
